# General Structure:
### Main Script (main.py):

- Central file for running the program.

- Includes functions to gather file types and invoke specific analyzers (call_python_analyzer and call_html_analyzer).

### Analyzers Module:

A well-structured set of Python files under the analyzers directory.

- BaseAnalyzer (base_analyzer.py): The foundational class for shared functionality.

- HTMLAnalyzer (html_analyzer.py): Specialized analyzer for handling HTML files.

- PythonProjectAnalyzer (python_analyzer.py): Handles Python-specific file analysis, including imports, functions      comments, and generating reports.

### Key Highlights:
Classes and Functions:

- Each analyzer extend the BaseAnalyzer class and implements specific methods (gather_files, analyze, etc.).

- The PythonProjectAnalyzer is robust, covering various aspects of Python code, such as comments, imports, functions, and reports.



## Next Steps:

1. Exception Handling:

- Ensure robust error-handling mechanisms, especially when analyzing files, to avoid crashes with unexpected inputs.

2. Enhance Modularity:

- If there are repetitive patterns across analyzers, consider abstracting them into reusable functions or methods in BaseAnalyzer.

3. Docstring Improvement:

- Revise the TODO areas to add comprehensive docstrings for better code readability and maintenance.

4. Testing:

- Incorporate unit tests to verify that each analyzer's methods (e.g., gather_files, clean_file) work as intended.
