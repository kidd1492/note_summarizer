# Note Summarizer Project

The **Note Summarizer** is a Python-based project analyzer designed to parse and analyze the structure of Python and Web base files could be great for Flask and Django projects. It will generate a CSV reports with each file type, and provide insights into the analyzed codebase. The project is structured to be easily extensible, supporting additional analyzers for other file types (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) in the future.


## Features
- The program collects all file paths in the specified directory for the supported file types (currently Python and HTML).
- Analyzer parse the file content, extract relevant information, and generate a CSV report including each file type.
- CSV report is saved in the csv_file directory as file_summary.
- The CSV files can be used for generating detailed reports, visualization, or further analysis.
- Easily integrates with projects built using frameworks like Django and Flask.


## Program Flow
```	
		                note_summarizer/
                           -—main.py  file in note_summarizer/—

def main():                     
—gather_categorized_files(directory):      
-generate_csv(categorized_files): 
    -analyzer.process_line_for_csv(line, file):---------|       analyzers/
-report_helper.type_of_report(categorized_files)        |	  --analyzer.py—
    |                                                   |--def process_line_for_csv(line, file):
    |   reports/                                              -write_csv_summary():
    |--csv_files/
    |    * file_summary.csv                                                 
    |--report_helper.py--                            
    |                                                  
    |----def type_of_report(categorized_files):      
          -file_type(): 
            -select_file(df, selected_file_type):
               -select_data(df, selected_file, selected_file_type, type):

    
    This will save a report to txt file working in interaction
    to print a full report on all files for selected file types

## Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/username/note_summarizer.git
Navigate to the project directory:
Set up your venv
pip install requirements.txt (pandas)


### Run the program:
bash
- python main.py # will give back enter report or directory path

1. run main.py with a directory path to analyze the files...
python main.py C:/Desktop/SomeDirectory  # if valid directory will generate the csv

2. To see the analyzed info...
python main.py report  # will show interaction for reports generated by csv.
