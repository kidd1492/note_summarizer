File Summarizer Tool
Overview
The File Summarizer Tool is a Python-based utility designed to gather and process files from a directory structure. It allows users to filter files by extension, exclude specific directories (e.g., .git, env, enve), and prepares the groundwork for summarizing or analyzing the content of those files.

Features
Directory Traversal: Recursively walks through a specified directory and its subdirectories.

File Filtering: Gathers only files with specified extensions (e.g., .py, .txt, .js).

Exclusion of Directories: Automatically skips directories like .git, env, and enve to streamline processing.

Customizability: Users can define their own list of allowed file extensions and directories to exclude.

Installation
To get started, you'll need:

Python 3.6 or higher

Basic familiarity with terminal or command-line usage

Clone the project repository (if hosted on GitHub):

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-summarizer-tool.git
cd file-summarizer-tool
Usage
Set the Target Directory: Update the target_directory variable in the main() function with the path to the folder you want to process.

Specify Allowed File Extensions: Define the file extensions you want to include in the allowed_extensions list (e.g., [".py", ".txt"]).

Run the Script: In your terminal or command prompt, execute the script:

bash
python gather_files.py
Output: The script will print a list of gathered files that meet the filtering criteria.

Next Steps
Implement a summarization feature to process and summarize the gathered files.

Add support for saving summarized content to a new directory or database.

Enhance error handling and logging for better robustness.
